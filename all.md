Not really useful but might add a script to do this

[fish]

vim .config/fish/config.fish
if ...
	fastfetch
end

[to-do]

Media control in center of bar (should be easy)

Might be better to have instead of alt + l to change keyboard layout, to remap the caps lock to nothing and bind the shortcut to just that,
and then I could remap num block to if pressed num lock, held caps lock
